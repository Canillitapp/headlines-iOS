     *  First approach was doing an OperationQueue with OperationBlocks
     *  but since I'm not going to handle their cancel / fail state I thought
     *  this was more clear.
     *
     *  I could also make FetchCategoriesOperation and FetchTrendingNewsOperation
     *  as Operation subclasses but it seemed too much work for something that it's
     *  not going to have reuse on other part of the app's lifecycle.
     *
     *  However, there's a something to have in mind: both operations are going to
     *  run no matter what. If some of the two fails and later user retries, both
     *  API calls are going to run.
     *
     *  Also, if both services fail, I'm gonna get just one error (the last one).
     *
     *  There's some room to improvement here :-)
